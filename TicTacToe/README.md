# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple **Tic-Tac-Toe (Noughts & Crosses)** game implemented in Python.  
Players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until one wins or the board is full (tie).

---

## 🚀 How to Play
1. Run the Python script in your terminal.
2. The board will be displayed with coordinates:
    - Rows: `0, 1, 2`
    - Columns: `0, 1, 2`
3. On your turn, enter the row and column where you want to place your mark (`X` or `O`).
4. The first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
5. If the board fills up with no winner, the game ends in a tie.
